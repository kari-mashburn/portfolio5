## Description of What's in My Stars

* What's in My Stars? is my Portfolio 5 project, using React and a third party API. It is meant for the user to go and look at their horoscope and the ability to view other information that comes with their horoscope reading, such as, your lucky time, lucky number, mood, color for the day, and compatibility with other signs.
* What's in My Stars? also includes a Frequently Asked Questions page for the users that want a better understanding of astrology and the zodiac.
* The third party API I used was [Aztro's Horoscope API](https://github.com/sameerkumar18/aztro)

## Problems I Encountered

* This month there were a few problems I had encountered, I wanted to use a different API along with the one I'm using in this project and the company never got back to me with the correct information on how to use their API properly since their documentation was incorrect and outdated. The current API I am using, I had some problems with them when I couldn't get the API call to work properly and they told me to do 36 different API calls for each sign and that took up a lot of my time but then I had figured out, with the help of my portfolio 5 instructor Sean, that I only needed one API call, which finally got working. After that there were some design flaws that came up and some components did not want to be styled correctly but I've worked out the kinks and it's finalized and I'm somewhat happy with how it turned out.
