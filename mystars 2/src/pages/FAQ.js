            <h4 class="subtitle">History</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">From immemorial times, watching the heavens has provided inspiration for mankind. Astrology is perhaps the most ancient arcane system of cosmic wisdom that links all life, creation, the universe and man.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Astronomy and astrology are intertwined; call them the twin sisters acknowledged by our ancient ancestors. Astronomy provides the foundation and structure from which astrology springs.</p>
            <h4 class="subtitle">Relevance Today & Pop Culture</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">There is a hung jury when we try to define astrology. Many say it is an art of divination. Others insist that it is only pure science. And the controversy goes on unresolved without offering a definitive answer.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We argue that it is both a science and an art. The scientific portion of astrology comes into play as we work with the astronomical, mathematical, and geometrical methods. Astrology is based on observation and correlation both in a scientific and divinatory manner. The ancients watched the sky, observing the movements of planets and other heavenly objects, recorded them and were then able to make quite accurate predictions as to their future appearances. That's science at work.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">They also began to observe when specific heavenly orbs in certain positions would correspond to changes in weather or events in their lives. This 'omen' divination was the earliest use of astrology.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">So in a nutshell, astrology is the oldest system of a universal wisdom for self-knowledge and awareness as well as divination using natural phenomenon.</p>
            </div>
            <div label='When was Astrology Developed?'>
            <p class="paragraph">Astrology has been often been referred to as the Golden Science, the Mother of all Divination. 'Astro' means Star and 'Logy' refers to Logos or intelligence.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Many archeologists have found evidence of its origins as far back as 4000 BC in the fertile crescent ï¿½ the cradle of civilization of Mesopotamia, today's modern day Iraq, in the city of Ur at the crossroads of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.</p>
            <h4 class="subtitle">B.C.E. (Before Common Era)</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">Both the Egyptians and the Babylonians have been credited with its conception for Western civilization, though it is thought that China and possibly India are the originators of the oldest form of astrology.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The ancients saw their gods and goddesses in the planets and their journeys across the nighttime sky. The astrology of those times was used for predicting weather patterns, outcomes of wars, births, deaths of kings, and other commonplace events that the survival of tribes were dependent upon.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Sumerian cuneiform tablets depict the earliest known writing about astrology. Actually, the astro-archeologists report that it was the Chaldeans who cast the very first birth charts.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">With the rise of the Ptolemy, the recording of Eclipses and other celestial events reached a high point somewhere around 750 BCE. Alexander the Great conquered Egypt and brought astrology to Greece.</p>
            <h4 class="subtitle">A.D. (Anno Domini)</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">In the Middle Ages of modern Western history, astrology was forced underground only to re-emerge during the Renaissance. It met with renewed interest and excitement during the 1800s in Europe from British rule in India, which opened doors of curiosity and consciousness.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">A major breakthrough came in the 1930s with spiritual advocates such as Madame Blavatsky and Alan Leo breathing new life into astrology, lending it to a more humanistic and personal application ï¿½ that of expanding one's self-awareness.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We can thank Sydney Omar's writings to bring astrology right to the foreground of modern day practices with the most used icebreaker, "what's your [Sun] Sign?".</p>

            <div label='What is a Horoscope?'>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Definition</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">The actual word 'horoscope' is derived from the Latin combination of two words in which 'Horo' means hour and 'Scope' means view, so it is a 'view of the hour.'</p>
              <p class="paragraph">One definition of 'horoscope' is that it is a delineation of particular celestial energies based on heavenly patterns, such as you see in magazines or newspapers.</p>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Astrologists</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">As astrologers we refer to the horoscope as the astrological chart of a person or a moment in time, which is calculated from the planetary positions in either the sidereal or tropical Zodiac. The calculations used are based on the date, place and time of birth. That's why a horoscope is so personal, like a fingerprint.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">When an astrologer works with an accurately-timed chart, the energies carried within it are unique to that individual. Be aware that the chart energies of the planets and signs serve as the potential for personal expression within that individual.</p>
              <h4 class="subtitle">The Horocope</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">The horoscope holds within it planets, signs, aspects, houses, and other points that reflect potential characteristics and patterns. It is our free will that allows us to work with these patterns or remold them to be expressed in other ways.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">Many people think that the horoscope writes our destiny in stone. Not so! It shows potentials...how we use those potentials is our personal prerogative. What the horoscope can offer is insight and awareness about these potentials and their uses.</p>            
            </div>
            <div label='What is a Zodiac?'>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Then</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">The Latin term Zodiac translates to 'zoo of animals'. This belt is one of the great circles of our astronomical heavenly vault. It is the path that our Sun takes (also called the ecliptic) in our galaxy that is dotted with 12 constellations, one for each of the signs of the Zodiac. Many of these constellations are animals, like the Crab, the Ram, the Lion and the Archer, while a few are people such as the Gemini twins, and Virgo the virgin..</p>
              <p class="paragraph">There are basically two systems to determine the planet's movement through the Zodiac. One is called Sidereal Zodiac, which uses the North star as the point of departure, and the other is the Tropical Zodiac. The latter Zodiac measures the movement from the Sun's position on the ecliptic on the first day of spring. This is called the Aries point at zero degrees. It moves backwards and marks the Vernal Equinox. The Tropical Zodiac also marks the beginning of each of our three other seasons..</p>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Now</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">Thousands of years ago the Sidereal and Tropical Zodiacs were congruous in movement. But today, due to the precession of the equinoxes, the Aries point at zero degrees in the Tropical Zodiac is today equated with six degrees in the constellation of Pisces. So, when you look at the heavens you are seeing the constellations in the Sidereal Zodiac..</p>
              <p class="paragraph">Most of today's Western astrologers calculate charts using the Tropical Zodiac. This is a point of great contention between the astronomers and astrologers, in which the astronomers regard the astrologers with disdain for not using the 'real' sky to calculate planetary positions.</p>            
            </div>
            <div label='What are the Key Planets in Astrology?'>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Broad Explanation</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">Key planets generally refer to the Sun and Moon in the chart, along with the ruler of the sign on the Ascendant. Not to diminish the importance of the other heavenly bodies, but these planets are the most personal points in the entire chart. Because of the personal interfacing, these planets reflect the most sensitive side of your being.</p>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Sun</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">The Sun is your purpose in life. It's what you have come here on Earth in the incarnation to do and express. If you are not expressing what your Sun needs then you will find yourself unhappy and consequently very unfulfilled.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">So often, especially younger people in their teens and early 20s, will ask "why am I here? What's my purpose?" That answer is found in their Sun and it's Zodiac Sign and the house placement in the chart wheel. Aspects to the Sun are indications if the individual will have an easy time fulfilling that purpose or not. Remember, the aspects color how easy or difficult the expression is and the Sun is all about self expression.</p>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Moon</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">The Moon is your emotional receptor. It holds your past memories and we can almost say your ancestral ties. The Sun is born to radiate, and the Moon to be receptive. The lunar principle is to collect and filter through the feelings. It's your sensory device and your inner radar, which is most beneficial if you take the time to listen and feel her responses in your gut.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">The Moon shows how you relate emotionally to yourself, nurture yourself, and emote. Again, the aspects the Moon makes in your chart will be very telltale about how you address emotional situations.</p>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Ascendant (You)</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">The Ascendant is what people see in you at a first glance. It's what you project of yourself to others. The ruling planet by sign, house, and aspect will give more information about your modus operandi - basic elements of your character and attitudes toward self and relationships.</p>

            <div label='What are the Zodiac Signs?'>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Definition</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">The 12 Zodiac Signs are seen in the sky in the constellations. Each has a wealth of mythological tales originating from all cultures. Each one represents an archetypal energy of consciousness.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">Libra, the scales, is the only inanimate object of the Zodiac signs. They say it ruled the Golden Age of Greece when beauty and the mind were at a height and balance was key.</p>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Scorpio, October 23 - November 21</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">Scorpio, the scorpion, ruled the Egyptian mystery schools along with the journeys to the underworld and its gods.</p>

              <p class="paragraph">Capricorn, the sea goat, represents the age when a certain 'take charge' attitude of authority is present; however, it can also become quite stoic with harsh rules.</p>
            </div>
            <div label='How are the Horoscope Signs Different?'>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Differences</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">Each sign of the Zodiac represents so many things. There are differences but also many similarities in the signs because they all belong to the 'whole' picture of astrology and the horoscope. There are families of signs that are categorized into groups of elements of Fire, Water, Air and Earth.</p>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Fire Signs and Attributes</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius are all Fire Signs, but each one expresses that fiery temperament in a different way. Fire is action oriented and contagious! Imagine three children have a red crayon. The Aries might use it as a sword to poke the air in an imaginary battle. The Leo might melt the crayon on paper to make it look like a Sunburst, and the Sagittarian might use it as a writing implement.</p>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Water Signs and Attributes</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">The Water Signs are Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces. They all represent the feeling body. Water as an element has many expressions; it can be a nurturing river like the sign Cancer, go to extremes of heated passion or icy cold like Scorpio, and compassionately embracing or disillusioned by fog like Pisces.</p>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Air Signs and Attributes</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">Gemini, Libra and Aquarius are the Air Signs. These represent the mental energies within us. Some people are very quick-witted, curious, and knowledgeable - that's Gemini! Others weigh things out and are considerate of others - that's Libra! And some are true innovators, unique and take those pathways not taken - and that's Aquarius!</p>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Earth Signs and Attributes</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">For the Earth Signs we have Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. Taurus needs to have physical stimulus to his physical senses. Virgo is the organizer and seeks precision and perfection in what he does, while Capricorn is the commander-in-chief ready to handle responsibilities for all.</p>              
            </div>
            <div label='How Do I Find Out More on Astrology?'>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Before the Internet</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">Years ago, if you were drawn to astrology, there was just one book on the shelf in the library. Today there is an overload of information through the innovation of the Internet. It can be overwhelming as well as difficult to wade through all the information to find the right fit for you.</p>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Today</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">So where should you go to find out more? Start as if you were seeking a physician to help you. First ask your friends for referrals, search the Yellow Pages, go to a local metaphysical bookstore, or even a health food store. You want a good, skilled, reputable astrologer. Check to see if your town or area has a local astrological chapter or group. Astrology groups offer lectures, workshops and conferences. Find national and international astrology organizations on the web and you'll see their list of members who are certified by their testing standards. You want the best for yourself!</p>
              <p class="paragraph">Then the first order of business is to have a professional astrologer unfold your chart. Be sure that the person you do work with is full-time in the field and ask them how long they've been making a full time living doing chart counseling. Also ask them to tell you their areas of expertise, what a session will give you, how long it is, and their fees.</p>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Suggestion</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">Another suggestion is to read as much as you can and take it all with a grain of salt. Not all writers are experts! Also check online to take classes with professionals at an online school. There are many now that offer classes for students at all levels with full-time professional astrologers who both teach and offer counseling sessions.</p>
            </div>

              <p class="paragraph">Most practicing astrologers today use astrology for self awareness, family, and clients. This self-contained system is probably the most complete system. It is interwoven with so many other paths of wisdom as well. Quaballa is rooted in astrology as are Numerology, Tarot, and Feng Shui.</p>
